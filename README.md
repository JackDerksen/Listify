# Listify
A simple Python program intended to eliminate the monotony of typing out lists. 

Simply run the program, and it will give you a few options for modes on how to enter your information. Type '?' for help, or 'X' to exit the program.
After entering your list components, the program will print a list that you can simply copy and paste into whatever program you need the list for.

I would recommend placing it in the default directory of you command prompt, as that makes it as easy as possible to run the program.
